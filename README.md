# Visualizer of AF data from Sony cameras JPEG and ARW (RAW) EXIFs

![alt text](a7rm2_afv.jpeg "AFV tool displaying focus data on photo made with ILCE-7RM2")

This tool allows to visualize some statuses of PDAF sensors or CAF stored in EXIF metadata of JPEGs and **RAW (ARW)** from Sony cameras. Auto focus statuses are parsed from EXIF and presented as ExifTool interprets them.
I.e. this tool show where are focus points.

**Most recent standalone single file (extracts all libs and runtime to temp folder, no python installed required) Win x64 version download link (no exiftool.exe included)**

[Win64 executable download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SK-Hardwired/s_afv/s-afv-python-27/dist/afv.exe)



With this tool you can see:
- For SLT cameras with 15-points PDAF (SLT-A33, SLT-A55, SLT-A35, SLT-A65, SLT-A57, SLT-A58):
  - AF hit status for each sensor at shutter release. AF hit displayed by colors from black to white. Black = out of focus. White = In Focus
  - If Face Detection was on, and Face(s) detected - they are highlighted with red frame
  - What AF points were used for final focus adjustments (have additional RED frame)
  - What AF point was reported as in Focus (Yellow circle)

- For SLT cameras with 19-points PDAF (SLT-A77, SLT-A99):
  - AF hit status for each sensor at shutter release. AF hit displayed by colors from black to white. Black = out of focus. White = In Focus
  - If Face Detection was on, and Face(s) detected - they are highlighted with red frame

- For CAF cameras (for example, DSC-RX100M4, DSC-RX10M3 and many other older Cybershots)
  - If Face Detection was on, and Face(s) detected - they are highlighted with red frame
  - What area was reported as in Focus (Yellow circle). Actually what camera thinks it focused at.

- For Hybrid AF cameras (like ILCE-5100, ILCE-6000, ILCE-6300, ILCE-6400, ILCE-6500, ILCE-7RM2,ILCA-99M2, ILCA-77M2, ILCE-9, ILCE-7RM3, ILCE-7M3, DSC-RX100M6, DSC-RX10M4, **DSC-RX100M7** and **ILCE-7RM4**)
  - If Face Detection was on, and Face(s) detected - they are highlighted with red frame
  - What area was reported as in Focus (Yellow circle). Actually what camera thinks it focused at.
  - What Focal Plane (on-sensor) AF points were used
  - Eye detection marker (when Eye AF used, no DPAF points data stored in exif, only Eye and Face positions recorded)
  - [ILCA-77M2, ILCA-99M2] Also Dedicated PDAF sensors statuses display

**Reads both JPEG/ARW**

This tool consists of:
  - afv.py - main script itself doing all drawing.
  - exiftool (should be downloaded separately (link below) and named as **exiftool.exe** and placed in the same folder as afv.py

  *Note: For easy use downloaded compiled already package)*

Prerequisities for launching source script:
  - Python 3.7 (code rewritten from Python 2.7 as it will be discontinued)
  - matplotlib module installed (http://matplotlib.org/ *or* pip install matplotlib)
  - rawpy (pip install rawpy) to read and render Sony RAW - **ARW** files)
  - pillow (pip install pillow *or* pip install pillow-simd) to load and show JPG
  - Phil Harvey's EXIFTool binary (named exiftool.exe) to be placed in the same folder as afv.py script. Exiftool download (http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/)

Warning! You will get no results or corrupted results if you JPEG photos (their EXIF) were modified or by image processing software. So please use JPEGs straight from the camera.
